# rise-slides [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Rise-Vision/rise-slides.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Rise-Vision/rise-slides) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Rise-Vision/rise-slides/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/Rise-Vision/rise-slides?branch=master)

`rise-slides` is a Polymer 3 Web Component that renders a Google Slides presentation

#### Example

```
  <rise-slides
    id="presentation"
    src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRK9noBs7XGTp-jRNkkxSR_bvTIPFq415ff2EKZIpUAOQJcYoV42XtxPGnGEd6bvjl36yZvjcn_eYDS/embed" duration="3000">
  </rise-slides>
```

### Labels

The component may define a 'label' attribute that defines the text that will appear for this instance in the template editor.

This attribute holds a literal value, for example:

```
  <rise-slides
    id="slides"
    label="Slides"
    src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRK9noBs7XGTp-jRNkkxSR_bvTIPFq415ff2EKZIpUAOQJcYoV42XtxPGnGEd6bvjl36yZvjcn_eYDS/embed" duration="3000">
  </rise-slides>
```

If it's not set, the label for the component defaults to "Slides", which is applied via the [generate_blueprint.js](https://github.com/Rise-Vision/html-template-library/blob/master/generate_blueprint.js) file for a HTML Template build/deployment.

### Attributes

This component receives the following list of attributes:

- **id**: ( string / required ): Unique HTMLElement id.
- **src**: ( string / required ): Google Slides source. Published URL of my Google Slides or Embed link provided by Google Slides
- **duration** (number / optional): Duration of a slide in seconds. Default is 10 seconds.
- **label**: ( string / optional ): An optional label key for the text that will appear in the template editor. See 'Labels' section above.
- **non-editable**: ( empty / optional ): If present, it indicates this component is not available for customization in the template editor.

- **_configured_**: The component has initialized what it requires to and is ready to handle a _start_ event.
